## Description
SOCprint web uses a [POSIXâ„¢-compliant, zero-dependency script](https://github.com/dlqs/SOCprint) to print in SOC NUS. No more printer driver installation, no more weird instructions. Hassle-free and privacy focused. 

The web client communicates with a backend that does NOT store any client credentials. This repository is a monorepository that contains both the client and server code.

## Motivation
spite and frustration

## Development Set-up

Follow the instructions in the subfolders.
